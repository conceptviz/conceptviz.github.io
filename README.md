# Gallery of Concept Visualization

The **Gallery of Concept Visualization** features projects which use pictures to communicate complex and difficult ideas, the same way data visualizations use pictures to make sense of data.

Pull requests are welcome!

* After cloning the repo, make sure to run `npm install` to sync up necessary NPM packages.
* During development, run `npm run start`. This starts a server at `localhost:3333` which automatically (hot-)reloads the site when a source file (`src/index.jsx` or `src/data.yaml`) changes. It's real cool.
* Before submitting a PR, run `npm run build` to generate a prod-ready `index.js`. Include this output as part of your PR; the use of github.io demands it!
